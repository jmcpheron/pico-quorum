Inherited picowallet scripts (`pico`, `push`, `emu`, `qr`, `wiring`, the `zez*` case generators
and more) are unchanged; see the upstream half of [`../README.md`](../README.md).

PicoQuorum additions:

- [`vectors/`](vectors/): generates the Safe hash test vectors

Still to come: a mock Safe transaction service (only the endpoints the console uses) and
provisioning scripts.
